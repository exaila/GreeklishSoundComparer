Greeklish Sound Comparer
======================

Greeklish Sound Comparer is a project which aims to ease the task of comparing Greek words with their Greeklish equivalents or even Greeklish to Greeklish.

The greatest problem of Greeklish is the fact that there isn't a proper way to use it.
The same word can be written in many different ways like the word Φόβος which can be written as phovos, fovos, fobos or even ph0v0s.

To overcome this problem GSC tries to associate a list of sounds to each combination of symbols.
Thus internally Φ, PH and F all have an associations with the same sound 'FI'.

GSC can be used to compare Greek strings with user entered strings like names in a database or 
make autocomplete suggestions from a list of Greek places while the users enters their Greeklish equivalent.
